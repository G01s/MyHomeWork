//C# is a multi paradigm programming language. It’s developed by Microsoft within the .NET initiative. C# covers strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.
 
//Other more commonly used programming languages that I can compare C# to are:

//•	C – is a general purpose programming language. It’s a foundation for some of the most commonly used languages in the world, like C++,         Object-C, JavaScript,             Java, PHP and many others.
//•	C++ - it’s an old programming language designed for general object-oriented programming on machines running command line UI. Although an old          Language C++ is still a very commonly used language.
//•	Java – The two languages are more alike than they differ. For me C# is the more technically advanced programming language. A lot can be said,         but this is my opinion.
