            //facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.
            //Most modern IDEs have intelligent code completion.
          //Some IDEs contain a compiler, interpreter, or both, such as Net Beans and Eclipse; others do not, such as SharpDevelop and Lazarus. The boundary between an integrated
            //development environment and other parts of the broader software development environment is not well-defined. Sometimes a version control system and various tools are 
            //integrated to simplify the construction of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Many modern IDEs also have a class browser, an object browser, and a class hierarchy diagram, 
            //for use in object-oriented software development.
